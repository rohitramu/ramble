"""This module contains the following external, potentially separately
licensed, packages that are included in Spack:

jsonschema
----------

* Homepage: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jsonschema
* Usage: An implementation of JSON Schema for Python.
* Version: 2.4.0 (last version before functools32 dependency was added)
* Note: functools32 doesn't support Python 2.6 or 3.0, so jsonschema
  cannot be upgraded any further until we drop 2.6.
  Also, jsonschema/validators.py has been modified NOT to try to import
  requests (see 7a1dd517b8).

ruamel.yaml
------

* Homepage: https://yaml.readthedocs.io/
* Usage: Used for config files. Ruamel is based on PyYAML but is more
  actively maintained and has more features, including round-tripping
  comments read from config files.
* Version: 0.11.15 (last version supporting Python 2.6)
* Note: This package has been slightly modified to improve Python 2.6
  compatibility -- some ``{}`` format strings were replaced, and the
  import for ``OrderedDict`` was tweaked.
